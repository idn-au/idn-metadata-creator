= IDN Metadata Creator

This repository contains a single page application (web page) form tool that, when filled out correctly, generates valid https://www.w3.org/RDF/[RDF] metadata, according to the https://linked.data.gov.au/def/idncp/spec[IDN Catalogue Profile], which can then be loaded into the https://idnau.org/catalogue[IDN Dataset Catalogue].

Currently this tool is for testing out and understanding the IDN Catalogue Profile's requirements for metadata so it doesn't submit metadata to the IDN systems automatically - it just prints it out for review. Automated submission might be added later.

When running, this application looks something like this:
